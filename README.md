A proper well structured documentation for getting started with chrome pwning &amp; v8 pwning 
Browsers are one of today’s most used pieces of technology. On every off the shelf computer, if we just plug and play we will see a browser installed.

Given the upper arguments I choose to study Google’s Javascript Engine, particularly v8.
